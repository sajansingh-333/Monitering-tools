why we need monitering?
Identify the systems and applications are accessible always to ensure its continuous availability
Identify the system downtime for maintenance so that the customers can be informed in advance
Manage the available IT budget efficiently
Generate an alert when an intruder/adversary tries to access the customer/employee data, which will be required in protection mechanism
Detect incidents in application as a first step in prevention mechanism
Track every user, network and system activity to detect abnormalities
Upgrade or replace the outdated system components to improve application performance
Understand the behaviour of applications using prewritten rules to detect performance issues
Automate repetitive tasks to improve application performance


Monitoring helps an organization to improve its system performance and eventually its business, to mention few monitoring scenarios:

Identify the systems and applications running in a Windows machine to ensure its continuous availability and performance
Monitor the system resource and performance of a Linux machine
Detect network outages and alert the administrator
Track database performance and resources in order to create and maintain a highly available application infrastructure.
View alerts generated by applications and system in real time in case an intruder tries to access customer/employee data
Analyze IT applications and resources and squash application bugs to ensure SLA is met

Types of monitering :

Windows Monitoring: End to end monitoring of Windows machine where the employees login to the machine and access their applications

Linux Monitoring: Monitoring the system resources and the databases that are hosted on the Linux machine so that the applications access the database to fetch customer data.

Network Monitoring: Monitoring the network connectivity ,between the customer and the bank so that the administrator is alerted when the network goes down.

Database Monitoring: Monitoring the databases, that contain customer data so that applications may access it to perform transactions without failing.

Security Monitoring: Protecting the customer data and employee data from intruders who use it to perform unauthorized transactions

Application Monitoring: Monitoring the IT applications that the employees and customers use,  to perform the transactions which meets SLA.
